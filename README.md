This project seeks to predict the Service Hours of industrial machines based on machine characteristics and historical maintenance event in order to optimize operational efficiency and minimize downtime. 

For prediction, this analysis employed machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest and KNN-Regressors. The insights are to empower businesses to schedule maintenance activities strategically, ultimately enhancing overall productivity and reducing operational disruptions.
